{"name":"InnoPub Media","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to InnoPub Media's GitHub Page.\r\nThis is where we will host open source and public stuff.\r\n\r\n[InnoPub Media](http://innopub.com) stands for **inno**vative **pub**lishing. We are a new media startup company organized by a couple of online community journalism pioneers based in Cebu City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAmong InnoPub Mediaâ€™s trailblazing projects are the production of electronic guidebooks and mobile apps on tourism areas in the Philippines and the data-tagging of tourism and heritage sites with QR or quick response codes and near-field communications (NFC) tags.\r\n\r\nThe two projects are part of the nationwide Digital Tourism program implemented in partnership with wireless services leader Smart Communications Inc. The program was commended by the Cebu City Council in a resolution passed on mass motion last January 2012. It was given an Anvil Award of Merit in February 2014.\r\n\r\nInnoPub is also the publisher of [MyCebu.ph](http://mycebu.ph), a top website all about Cebu.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
